I created a 3D Bugatti car website with the help of ChatGPT. It provided me with the basic structure and code for the website, along with an initial 3D model setup. Using that as the foundation, I made several modifications to enhance the project.

First, I integrated a 3D model of a Bugatti car, which brings a realistic and interactive feel to the website. I also added card flip effects to showcase details in a stylish and modern way, making the design more engaging for users. To make the site visually appealing, I included glowing color effects, giving it a sleek, futuristic appearance that complements the 3D car model perfectly.

By combining these features—3D visuals, interactive card flips, and glowing effects—the website now delivers an immersive and dynamic user experience. The final result you see is a product of continuous improvement, starting from a simple base code and evolving into a complete, professional-level project.

This project demonstrates how AI tools like ChatGPT can provide a strong starting point, while creativity and customization bring the final vision to life.
